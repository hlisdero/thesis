In this chapter, the literature on formal verification of Rust code
and Petri net modeling for deadlock detection is briefly reviewed.
Some of these previous publications contain approaches
that have guided this work.

In the next two sections, we will look at the existing tools,
their scope and their goals compared to the tool developed in this thesis.

Afterward, a survey of the existing Petri net libraries in the Rust ecosystem
as of early 2023 is provided to justify the need to implement a library
from the ground up.

As the next step, we explore the research community behind the \acrfull{MCC}
and the model checkers that participate in it
to confirm the potential of these tools
to analyze Petri net models of significant size.
This is relevant since the model checker acts
as the backend to the tool developed in this work.

Finally, three of the existing file formats for exchanging Petri nets are presented
and their purpose in the context of this work is explained.
