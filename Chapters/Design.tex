Now that the relevant background topics have been covered,
we can proceed to delve into the specifics of the design of the translation process.
The design is marked by three crucial architectural choices
that will be elaborated on in this chapter:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The decision to utilize the Rust compiler as a backend for the translation.
    \item Basing the translation on the \acrfull{MIR}.
    \item Inlining function calls when side-effects are present.
\end{enumerate}

Throughout the course of this chapter,
we will conduct an in-depth analysis
of the Rust compiler's internal mechanisms and its relevant compilation stages.
