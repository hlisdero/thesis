@misc{reid:hatra:2020,
  abstract      = {Formal verification of software is a bit of a niche
                   activity: it is only applied to the most safety-critical or
                   security-critical software and it is typically only performed by
                   specialized verification engineers. This paper considers whether
                   it would be possible to increase adoption of formal methods by
                   integrating formal methods with developers' existing practices
                   and workflows.
                   
                   
                   We do not believe that widespread adoption will follow from
                   making the prevailing formal methods argument that correctness
                   is more important than engineering teams realize. Instead, our
                   focus is on what we would need to do to enable programmers to
                   make effective use of formal verification tools and techniques.
                   We do this by considering how we might make verification tooling
                   that both serves developers' needs and fits into their existing
                   development lifecycle. We propose a target of two orders of
                   magnitude increase in adoption within a decade driven by
                   ensuring a positive `weekly cost-benefit' ratio for developer
                   time invested.},
